# Arduino Nametag
This project was initially built for an [Adafruit Huzzah32 - ESP32 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) using an [Adafruit 8x16 LED Matrix FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3154). The Huzzah32 board was excessive for this project because it also contains WiFi and Bluetooth modules, however this leaves the door open to further expansion.

Here's a video showing some of the animations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O2t_uX8Pw0

## Acknowledgements
The space alien bitmaps and some of the animation was taken from a [different project](https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-slash-gemma-space-invader-pendant/source-code) created by Adafruit.

The text scrolling animation was taken from the [minimatrix 8x16 example sketch](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack/blob/master/examples/minimatrix16x8/minimatrix16x8.ino) created by Adafruit.

This [website](https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/#99bbff99bb99ff7e]) created by [xantorohara](https://github.com/xantorohara) is very helpful for creating your own Pixel Art for the LED Matrix. I used it to prototype my bitmaps for the Ghost and Pacman.
